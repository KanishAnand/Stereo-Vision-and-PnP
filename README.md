# Stereo Vision and Non-linear optimization in PnP
In this project 3d points cloud is created from images of left and right view of a scene (the way our eyes work :eyes:). In second part iterative Perspective-from-n-Points (PnP) algorithm is implemented with Non-Linear Least Squares method to recover the camera pose.
